## Overview

This project is a web application aimed at improving cognitive skills - specifically memory. The application provides a series of memory improvement games such as the Long Number Memory game, the Shimp Test, and Sequence Memorization. The goal is to offer users fun and interactive ways to challenge and enhance their memory through engaging activities.

-------------------------------------

## Key Features

1. **Memory Improvement Games**
   - **Long Number Memory:** Users are shown a long sequence of numbers and must recall them in the correct order.
   - **Chimp Test:** A visual memory game where users must remember and select numbers or items in the correct sequence as they disappear.
   - **Sequence Memorization:** Users are shown a sequence of items and must recall the exact order.

2. **User Progress Tracking**
   - Track the performance of users across multiple sessions and provide insights on their cognitive improvements.

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Fully responsive UI built with **React** and **TypeScript** to ensure compatibility with various devices.

-------------------------------------

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:**
  - **C# .NET Core Web API:** The server-side logic is built using .NET Core to provide APIs that handle game logic, data persistence, and user interactions.
  
- **Frontend:**
  - **React with TypeScript:** The frontend is built with React, a modern JavaScript library, using TypeScript.
  
- **Database:** 
  - This will depend on the final architecture and will be specified later in project creating process.
